# Real-Time Crypto Pipeline

This project is a real-time data pipeline built with Python. It simulates a mini data engineering workflow by ingesting, processing, and storing cryptocurrency prices in real-time.

### 📌 Project Goals
- Practice real-time ingestion from a public API
- Perform lightweight transformation and filtering
- Store clean data locally in organized formats (CSV or database)
- Build modular, production-ready code structure

### 📁 Project Structure
- `ingestion/` → scripts to pull data from the API
- `processing/` → scripts to clean, filter, or transform data
- `storage/` → save data into CSV or a database
- `analysis/` → explore data with pandas/SQL/plots

### ✅ Status
In progress — starting from ingestion module.
