# Bitcoin Price Tracking Project

This project fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin & Ethereum), saves them with timestamps, and visualizes the price trends over time using Python.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- **Data Format**: JSON file updated every 15 seconds during the run

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Requests**: For API calls
- **Datetime & Time**: For timestamps and delays
- **Matplotlib**: To create visual charts
- **JSON & OS**: File management and data handling

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Fetch Data**: Grabs real-time Bitcoin and Ethereum prices
2. **Add Timestamps**: Attaches current UTC time to each data point
3. **Save to JSON**: Appends each fetch into a single `.json` file
4. **Plot Data**: Extracts & visualizes Bitcoin price trends over time

```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements (e.g., requests, matplotlib)
3. Run `test_ingestion.py` to begin fetching live data
4. After a few minutes, run `plot_prices.py` to see price trends

```bash
python test_ingestion.py  # Start collecting prices
data/crypto_prices.json   # JSON grows every 15s
python plot_prices.py     # Shows the chart
```
